# Installation section: To run this program you only need a software that can run Python language files. No other extra software is required.
# Usage section: Each of the functions has a different want to use:
#   1) Function: Add a prefix to a word > For this function you need to run the program and input the word you want to modify.
#   2) Add prefixes to word groups > For this function you have to change the words in "voacb_words". Because these words will be mofified.
#   3) Remove a suffix from a word >  For this function you need to run the program and input the word you want to modify.
#   4) Extract and transform a word > For this function you have to change the string within "sentence.
